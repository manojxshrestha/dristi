## Workflow Integration with Dristi

This agent works alongside the Dristi MCP server and WSTG methodology:

1. **Read the methodology** → `get_wstg_test("WSTG-INPV-17")` for baseline technique guidance
2. **Check related prompt** → read `prompts/input-validation.md` for Dristi-specific workflow
2. **Deep testing** — See [Deep Testing](../docs/deep-testing.md) for request mutation, fuzzing, and entry point techniques. Run before class-specific payloads.

3. **BurpSuite pro workflow — See [Burp Suite Flow](../docs/burp-flow.md) for full Burp MCP tool reference (proxy, repeater, intruder, collaborator, scanner, organizer) and per-phase workflow. **HTTP smuggling technique**: Use `burp_create_repeater_tab()` to craft CL.TE, TE.CL, and TE.TE obfuscation templates. Install HTTP Request Smuggler extension for automated detection. Use `burp_send_http1_request()` for precise request structure control.
4. **Playwright browser** — Use `playwright_browser_*` tools for active testing, SPA interaction, and PoC evidence. See [Browser Testing](../docs/browser-testing.md) for full reference.
5. **Find vulnerabilities** → `log_finding()` or `findings_add_vuln()` to persist to SQLite
6. **Log findings** → `findings_add_vuln(engagement_id, title, severity, ..., test_id="WSTG-INPV-17")`
7. **Track coverage** → `track_test(engagement_id, test_id="WSTG-INPV-17", status="completed", notes=...)`
8. **Chain findings** → `findings_add_chain()` to record multi-step attack paths
9. **Generate report** → `findings_handoff()` for cross-session handoff or `generate_report()` for final output

## PayloadsAllTheThings Reference

This agent has a corresponding reference library at `knowledge/payloads/Request Smuggling/` (182 lines).
Read the README before/during testing for enriched methodology and bypass techniques:

- **Methodology**: Detection techniques for different contexts and frameworks
- **Payloads**: Classified payloads by injection point and filter type
- **Bypass Patterns**: WAF/filter evasion specific to HTTP-SMUGGLING
- **Labs**: PortSwigger and real-world practice labs

## Scope Notice

- **Advisory mode** (default): You provide methodology, payloads, and analysis. The user executes commands.
- **Execution mode**: If the user has a declared scope in Dristi (`findings_init()`), you may compose commands for the user to run.

## Http Smuggling Testing

## 17. HTTP REQUEST SMUGGLING
> Lowest dup rate. $5K–$30K. PortSwigger research by James Kettle.

### CL.TE (Content-Length front, Transfer-Encoding back)
```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 13
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

SMUGGLED
```

### Detection
```
2. Burp extension: HTTP Request Smuggler
3. Right-click request → Extensions → HTTP Request Smuggler → Smuggle probe
4. Manual timing: CL.TE probe + ~10s delay = backend waiting for rest of body
```

### Impact Chain
```
Poison next request → access admin as victim
Steal credentials → capture victim's session
Cache poisoning → stored XSS at scale
```

## Target-Suitability Matrix (2026 reality check)

The classic CL.TE / TE.CL payloads are NOT universally exploitable in 2026. Modern proxies are RFC 9112 strict by default. Fingerprint the front-end BEFORE investing time.

| Front-end | CL.TE | TE.CL | H2.CL | H2.TE | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Nginx ≥ 1.21** | NO | NO | partial (H2 ingress) | partial | RFC-strict; rejects CL+TE with HTTP 400. Verified locally on Nginx 1.27 — all 9 documented variants killed by front-end ([docs/verification/phase2h-smuggling-cachepoison.md](../../docs/verification/phase2h-smuggling-cachepoison.md)). |
| **Caddy 2.x** | NO | NO | — | — | Hardened by default |
| **Envoy ≥ 1.20** | NO | NO | partial | partial | Hardened in most paths |
| **HAProxy ≤ 2.4** | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | **Vulnerable**, see CVE-2021-40346 |
| **AWS ALB + specific upstream** | partial | partial | ✓ | ✓ | Several disclosed-paid reports 2022-2024 |
| **Cloudflare → S3 / Lambda chains** | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | H2-downgrade attacks remain viable |
| **Older F5 BIG-IP (TMM < 16)** | ✓ | — | — | — | Vendor advisories |
| **Citrix ADC / NetScaler (older firmware)** | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | Disclosed in 2020-2022 |
| **Squid 3.x** | ✓ | — | — | — | Older deployments |
| **Apache Traffic Server (older)** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | PortSwigger research |
| **Custom Python / Go proxies** | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | Frequently miss RFC enforcement |

### Operator fingerprint quick-check

```bash
curl -sI https://target/ | grep -i "Server:"
```

- `nginx/1.21+`, `Caddy`, `envoy` → CL/TE classic is dead — pivot to H2.CL/H2.TE if the front-end speaks HTTP/2, or look for legacy proxies upstream
- `HAProxy`, header points to AWS/CDN → run the full payload matrix
- No Server header → assume hardened, but run a single quick `space-before-colon` probe; if it doesn't 400, dig deeper

### H2.CL / H2.TE (the modern dominant vector)

H2-downgrade smuggling attacks rely on the front-end speaking HTTP/2 to the client and HTTP/1.1 to origin. The downgrade introduces CL/TE confusion because HTTP/2's frame-length headers don't survive the conversion cleanly. Most CDN+origin chains in 2024-2026 use this exact topology.

Tools that send HTTP/2 raw frames (Burp Pro's HTTP Request Smuggler extension, `h2csmuggler`, `smuggler.py`) are the right starting point against CDN-fronted targets. Avoid HTTP/1.1-only test clients (curl, raw sockets) against H2-front-ended targets — you'll send the wrong protocol entirely.

## Related Skills & Chains

- **`cache-poison-hunter`** — Smuggling + cache is the canonical critical chain; one smuggled request becomes the cached response for every subsequent victim. Chain primitive: CL.TE smuggle a request whose response body contains attacker HTML/JS → front-end cache stores it under a popular URL (`/`, `/login`) → de-sync poisoning where the smuggled request becomes the cached response for the next N victims, persisting for the cache TTL.
- **`auth-bypass-hunter`** — Smuggling reaches internal-only routes that the front-end WAF/auth-proxy filters out. Chain primitive: smuggle `GET /admin/users HTTP/1.1` past the front-end ACL that blocks external `/admin/*` → backend processes the smuggled request as if from a trusted internal source → bypass front-end auth by smuggling internal-routed request → admin data in the response queue.
- **`idor-hunter`** — Smuggling attaches the NEXT user's session cookies to an attacker-controlled request path. Chain primitive: smuggle `GET /api/me HTTP/1.1` with no cookies → backend pairs it with the next legitimate user's incoming connection cookies → victim's session cookie attached to attacker's smuggled request → attacker reads the response containing victim's PII/tokens.
- **`xss-hunter`** — Smuggling injects XSS payloads into the response stream of the next victim without ever appearing in a URL parameter. Chain primitive: smuggled request body contains reflected payload that the backend renders into the next response in the queue → next visitor to `/` receives attacker HTML inline → reflected XSS at every visitor without any URL parameter visible to them or to logs.
- **`security-arsenal`** — Reach for the smuggling payload bank (CL.TE / TE.CL / TE.TE obfuscations, H2.CL downgrade probes, h2csmuggler one-liners, Burp HTTP Request Smuggler extension config) and the time-delay confirmation template before manual hex-editing.
- **`triage-validator`** — Run the Pre-Severity Gate before claiming Critical: the smuggled-request effect MUST land on a request issued by a different client/session, not your own follow-up. A timing delta in your own browser alone is parser disagreement, not exploitable smuggling.
